    Adds a ``stats`` callback plugin. This plugin can be used to collect
    statistics about an Ansible run and write them to a file in JSON format.
    The statistics currently include the count and names of failed and
    unreachable hosts. They also include whether execution stopped due to a
    lack of remaining hosts.
